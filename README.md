# Blinkit Grocery Data Analysis

This project performs an in-depth analysis of Blinkit grocery sales data using SQL. The goal is to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and gain insights into the factors that influence sales performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `BLINKIT - DATA/BlinkIT Grocery Data.csv`. It contains transactional data for various products sold through different Blinkit outlets.

### Dataset Columns

*   `Item_Fat_Content`: The fat content of the product (e.g., 'Low Fat', 'Regular').
*   `Item_Identifier`: A unique identifier for each product.
*   `Item_Type`: The category of the product (e.g., 'Fruits and Vegetables', 'Frozen Foods').
*   `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: The year the outlet was established.
*   `Outlet_Identifier`: A unique identifier for each outlet.
*   `Outlet_Location_Type`: The type of location where the outlet is situated (e.g., 'Tier 1', 'Tier 3').
*   `Outlet_Size`: The size of the outlet (e.g., 'Small', 'Medium', 'High').
*   `Outlet_Type`: The type of outlet (e.g., 'Supermarket Type1', 'Supermarket Type2').
*   `Item_Visibility`: The visibility of the product in the store.
*   `Item_Weight`: The weight of the product.
*   `Total_Sales`: The total sales generated by the product.
*   `Rating`: The customer rating for the product.

## SQL Analysis

The analysis is performed using the SQL script `Blinkit_Data Query.sql`. This script contains queries to clean the data, calculate KPIs, and perform a granular analysis of sales.

### Key Analysis Steps

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Standardizes the `Item_Fat_Content` column to ensure consistency (e.g., mapping 'LF' and 'low fat' to 'Low Fat').

2.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   **Total Sales:** Calculates the total revenue generated.
    *   **Average Sales:** Determines the average revenue per sale.
    *   **Number of Items:** Counts the total number of items sold.
    *   **Average Rating:** Calculates the average customer rating for items.

3.  **Granular Analysis:**
    *   **Sales by Fat Content:** Analyzes how sales performance varies between 'Low Fat' and 'Regular' items.
    *   **Sales by Item Type:** Identifies which product categories contribute the most to sales.
    *   **Sales by Outlet:** Compares sales across different outlet locations, sizes, and establishment years.

4.  **Chart-Ready Queries:**
    *   Includes queries formatted to be easily used for creating visualizations, such as:
        *   Percentage of sales by outlet size.
        *   Sales distribution by outlet location.
        *   A comprehensive breakdown of all KPIs by outlet type.

## How to Use

To replicate this analysis, you will need a SQL environment with the ability to import data from a CSV file.

1.  **Load the Data:** Import the `BLINKIT - DATA/BlinkIT Grocery Data.csv` file into a table named `blinkit_data` in your database.
2.  **Run the Queries:** Execute the queries from the `Blinkit_Data Query.sql` file against the `blinkit_data` table to perform the analysis.

The `BLINKIT - DATA/Query Doc.docx` and `Blinkit_Data Query.pdf` files contain additional documentation about the queries and the project.
